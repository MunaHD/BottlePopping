# Exercise - Bottle Popping

A stretch activity from LHL (W01D5)

In this exercise we create a function to help with the recycling of pop bottles for a grocery chain.

The recycling plan is as follows:

- Each bottle of pop costs $2 to purchase
- For every two empty bottles, you get a free bottle.
- For every four bottle caps, you get a free bottle.

The function should be called from the command line with the amount of money the customer will use to purpchase the bottles of pop.

Once ran, the function should print a summary of the transaction.

## Usage

example:

```
> npm poppinBottles.js 40

TOTAL BOTTLES: 75
REMAINING BOTTLES: 1
REMAINING CAPS: 3
TOTAL EARNED:
  BOTTLES: 37
  CAPS: 18
```
